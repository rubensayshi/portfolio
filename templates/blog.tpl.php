<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>
	Eventhough I really like sharing my knowledge with other people I'm not a very active blogger. <br />
	I feel rather useless if I'm blogging for 5 readers a month and that breaks down my motivation a lot (and as a result my amount of posts). <br />
	As a result I'll never reach more then 5 readers a month and this vicious circle won't break unless I find some other people to combine our writing powers! <br /> 
</p>
<p>
	So instead of blogging continuesly about whatever comes up in my mind I'll just limit myself to writing about major changes in my (professional) life.

<h3>The website is done - part 1 <small>21-11-2011</small></h3>
<p>
	Okay, this required a lot more effort then I expected! <br />
	Once I got going I found out that even an (almost) static website takes a lot of effort! Especially filling the content! <br />
	I'm fairly satisfied with most of the text I've written (a lot of it is even proper english) and I personally like the look of it. <br />
	It only has a few flashy parts (the menu and portfolio pages) but I'm satisfied with their feel (and code, gotta love CSS3).  
</p>
<p>
	As for the code behind it, it's clean and works like a charm! But ... There have been severial ocasion where I had to stop myself (after about an hour) to avoid writing a completely new framework. <br />
	Bit of a waste of those few hours but oh well, it's always fun to write those pieces of code even if you revert them afterwards! <br />
	<br />
	I'm pretty sure that as soon as I've finish adding a few more portfolio items and projects and when I'm done with my first job application I'm gonna rewrite the whole thing though! <br />
	I think Django looks really awesome (about as awesome as Symfony2 and it even shares the same template syntax!) and I want to give it a try! <br />
	<br />
	Since the code behind the website is actually a part of displaying what skills I've got I'm still in doubt weither I should wait with sending the job application untill I've rewritten the site though ...
</p>
<p>
	Now back to taking screenshots of the projects I've done in the past ...

<h3>Looking for a new job <small>01-11-2011</small></h3>
<p>
	After a 6 month internship at Hoppinger I graduated and got a job there as webdeveloper. <br />
	Starting at the bottom of the foodchain I quickly worked myself up from being the new kid on the block (junior developer) to a valued asset of the team of webdevelopers. <br />
	Mostly thanks to me being very selfsufficient and independant I was able to quickly gain the status of 'senior' webdevelop, being able to build and maintain (large) webapplications on my own and contribute (A LOT) to the development of the homebrew CMS which Hoppinger has been using for years. <br />
	I got a lot of chances to grow at Hoppinger and I don't think I could have for any better company to be my first employer! <br />
	<br />
	The confidence the people at Hoppinger had in me greatly influenced how I've grown as a webdeveloper and I even got to lead a team of developers when we completely redid the <a href="http://www.gites.nl">Gites</a> website, which has been one of the biggest projects Hoppinger has done!
</p>
<p>
	After we changed our main framework/CMS to Drupal and I've had the honor to stand at the base of the automation tool we've created for Drupal (<a href="http://voiture.hoppinger.com/">Voiture</a>) which will mostlikely power many more Drupal sites for Hoppinger in the future. <br />
	We even got the chance to present this project to the Drupal community on the largest dutch Drupal event <a href="http://www.drupaljam.nl/">DrupalJam</a> and our very own <a href="http://drupal.nl/evenement/drupal-tech-talk">Drupal Tech Talk</a>.
</p>
<p>
	My personal interest wavered during our initial Drupal period at Hoppinger and (mostly) in my own freetime I've gone through most PHP5.3 frameworks finaly ending up in love with Symfony2. <br />
	After reaching the point that I was confident enough to use Symfony2 in production (this was when Symfony2 was still in the final betas though) I got a chance at Hoppinger to use it! More then once! Woohoo!!
</p>
<p>
	So now after 4 years I've reached the point where I've gotten so curious about how the rest of the webdevelopment world does things and learned so much that I want to find a new employer which can offer me more experienced developers around me to learn from!
</p>
<p>
	Big shout out to all the Hoppingers, you guys will always be my first! <br />
</p>
