<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>
	The 'dierenambulance' - AKA animal ambulance - in the area of Rotterdam has a call center which is manned by volunteers. <br />
	We created a webapplication to keep a good adminstration of all the calls coming in and how they should be handled (which car, where, when) and eventually who should be billed for their work. <br />
	The application was build in a couple of phases. The last step starting next year, to actually feed the software in the ambulance with the data where they should be going.
