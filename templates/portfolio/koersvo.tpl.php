<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>
	KoersVO is an organization consisting of about 100 schools in (the area of) Rotterdam. <br />
	We create a tool which allows the schools to create a profile, answering a lot of questions about their type of education and the 'special' treatments they offer.<br />
	Based on this KoersVO can generate statistics and determine how well the schools cover the different needs in (the area of) Rotterdam.
</p>
<p>
	The profile consists of 4 steps, each containing 3~7 sub-steps, which in return are about 1~2 pages long. <br />
	Over the course of years the questions will change, be removed or more are added.
</p>
<p>
	I've created a custom 'schema' definition of the profiles which is easy enough to edit for a junior webdeveloper or intern and even has the potential to be administrated through a webinterface if it should ever be requested. <br />
	This was a lot of fun, specially since it was rather complex to corectly seperate the schema (config), from the data (profile) and the rendering of the profiles.
	In combination with validation, exports to excell and SPSS and priting it as a beautifull PDF.
