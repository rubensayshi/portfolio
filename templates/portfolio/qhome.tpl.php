<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>
	Qhome offers vacation homes for rent (and sale) in France. <br />
	Originally a client of <a href="<?php echo url("portfolio/gites"); ?>">Gites</a> they wanted a seperate website with their own brand and more information about their company. <br />
	Since they already supplied Gites with a lot of content about the vacation homes we've created a sync from the Gites website to their website over a simple API. 
</p>
<p>
	Creating syncs between websites can always be tedious but in return the complexity is also a lot of fun!
