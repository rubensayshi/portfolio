<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>
	Timerime is a webapplication offering the posibility to create a timeline and populate it with events and periods. <br />
	The public portal website allows free creation of these timelines and holds about ~20.000 timelines. <br />
	To be able to embed the timelines in your own website you can pay for a business account and this will allow you to embed the timeline together with a lightbox showing the information of the events. <br />
	As of late there are also a lot of schools using their own (seperated) portal website to have their students create a timeline as a final product of their class. <br />
</p>
<p>
	I've been the main developer to maintain the timerime website and since the website has grown a lot (in trafic and functionality) this wasn't an easy job. <br />
	Timerime is based on the HoppingerCMS, a system orientated for (medium trafic) business websites, over the past two years we've been very creative optimizing this. <br />
