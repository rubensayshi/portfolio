<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>
	We've developed a new website for the local (tv and radio) broadcasting station in Rotterdam. <br />
	They're the largest local broadcasting station in the Neterlands and already have a high load on their current website and are aiming for a lot more with their new website. <br />
	<br />
	The website is based on Drupal 6 and a big pile of modules which have already been developed by another company so that all the local broadcasting stations can use the same base and the idea was that this would save them on development costs. <br />
	Unfortunatly the modules are of average Drupal contrib quality which comes down to most being very bloated and the only thing saving the performance of the website is using insanely aggresive cache settings. <br />
	<br />
	We've ditched most modules provided and rewrote many to fit the specific needs of RTVRijnmond. <br />
	Most noticably is the rewritten import modules (for all the content from the old site) going from about 4~5 days of import time to just 2 hours! <br />
	Somehow other broadcasting stations (and the developers) found running an import script for multiple days acceptable, we didn't! How would you even go testing that?! <br />
	<br />
	The website is curently in development and we're soon releasing a (public) beta. <strong>The new website won't be live untill 29 november!</strong><br />
	<br />
	On the side I've also created a small webapplication which allows partners / relations of RTVRijnmond to maintain their 'teletext' pages. <br />
	Luckily we were allowed to build this with Symfony2 and I also threw in twitter bootstrap just to give it and shot (and loved it!). <br />
