<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
	Ruben de Vries <br />
	Webdeveloper <br />
	Fanatic snowboarder, gamer <br />
</p>

<h3>I'm a webdeveloper</h3>
<p>
	And on contrary to belief that's <strong>defenatly</strong> not a script kiddie sitting in his attic nor is it a so-called 'code monkey' which you feed pizza in exchange for a website!
</p>
<p>
	Developing so-called 'webapplications' requires a continiously expanding skillset to fit the needs of clients and an open mind to any new techniques out there. <br />
	Actually, any webdeveloper who really loves his job should be 'open minded' and is always searching for the next new thing which might change the world!
</p>
<h3>My personal slogan</h3>
<p>
	I live and work by a couple of slogans and quotes, but my favorite work related one: <br />
	<i>Everything I build older then 1 month is crap!</i> <br />
	<br />
	Okay, maybe a bit harsh, but since as a webdeveloper we have to be pragmatic and often you'd want to expand your code more, make it more robust and extensible, 
	BUT that the client who's paying you will never have any benifit from it! <br />
	That means you can always do better, combining that with the fact that I'm learning new things super fast my previous project will always look worse then my last/current project.

<h3>This Website</h3>
<p>
	I've created this website to tell the world a little bit about myself. <br />
	And ofcourse because I love building websites and I'm always looking for a reason to create a new website and try out new things! <br />

<h3>Highlighted project: Voiture</h3>
<p>
	Voiture is an SVN-based integrated deployment automation tool for small development teams that develop Drupal (v6 or v7) sites on an *nix/LAMP stack!

<h3>Latest blog: The website is done - part 1 <small>21-11-2011</small></h3>
<p>
	Okay, this required a lot more effort then I expected! <br />
	Once I got going I found out that even an (almost) static website takes a lot of effort! Especially filling the content! <br />
