<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>
	I've created this website to tell the world a little bit about myself. <br />
	And ofcourse because I love building websites and I'm always looking for a reason to create a new website and try out new things!
</p>

<h4>It's (almost) static!</h4>
<p>
	So as we speak this website is still almost completely static! <br />
	Since I prefer editing pages in HTML over a WYWIWYG editor and I needed a (new) portfolio up in running as soon as posible I've chosen to build it from scratch and only use some PHP to avoid having to copy paste common parts of the website (such as header / footer / menu).<br />
	The code it's running on is very to the point. I've already used it for another side project to since it's easy and reliable!<br />
	<br />
	On the other hand there have been serveral moments where I was going wild with writing new code and after 30~60 minutes just reverting it because I realized it'd have to build a complete framework if I really wanted to satisfy myself! 
</p>

<h4>The design</h4>
<p>
	I'm not creative with colors, shapes and images at all! So I've gone for a back and white design which I've created by just starting with some HTML and CSS. <br />
</p>

<h4>Future plans ...</h4>
<p>
	I'm curently looking for a new job and when I find one I intend to rebuild this website based on the programming language and framework the company I'll be working for uses. <br />
	That way I can quickly get used to any new things they might throw at me! 
</p>

<h4>Deprecated plans</h4>
<p>
	So I was planning to make this website all flashy and bouncy with fancy animations and transitions ... and I did ... and it distracted WAY to much from the purpose of this website! <br />
	To bad for people looking for flashy bouncy stuff, lucky for those who actually came to read something about me. <br />
	Maybe I'll add some 'bouncy mode' to the website you can toggle on and off soon!
</p>

<h4>The code</h4>
<p>
	I love open source and I love git and github! So you can checkout the code which this website is running on on github: <a href="https://github.com/rubensayshi/portfolio">https://github.com/rubensayshi/portfolio</a><br />
	You'll most likely be looking at the master branch, other branches might include new upcoming features or things that I've removed already!
</p>

<h4>The domain</h4>
<p>
	It's getting rather hard to find a decent domainname these days since there are so many people creating (personal) websites. <br />
	I'm aware of the fact that 'rubensayshi' is not correct english, but 'rubensaishi' doesn't look that good.
