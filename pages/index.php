<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
	Ruben de Vries <br />
	Webdeveloper <br />
	Fanatic snowboarder, gamer <br />
</p>

<h4>I'm a webdeveloper</h4>
<p>
	And on contrary belief that's <strong>defenatly</strong> not a script kiddie sitting in his attic nor is it a so called 'code monkey' which you feed pizza in exchange for a website!
</p>
<p>
	Developing so-called 'webapplications' requires a continiously expanding skillset to fit the needs of clients and an open mind to any new techniques out there. <br />
	Actually, any webdeveloper who really loves his job goes being an 'open mind' and is always searching for the next new thing which might change the world!

<h4>This Website</h4>
<p>
	I've created this website to tell the world a little bit about myself. <br />
	And ofcourse because I love building websites and I'm always looking for a reason to create a new website and try out new things! <br />
