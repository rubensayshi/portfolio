<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
	Ruben de Vries <br />
	Webdeveloper <br />
	Fanatic snowboarder, gamer
</p>

<h4>I'm a Webdeveloper</h4>
<p>
	And on contrary belief that's <strong>defenatly</strong> not a script kiddie sitting in his attic nor is it a so called 'code monkey' which you feed pizza in exchange for a website!
</p>
<p>
	Developing so-called 'webapplications' requires a continiously expanding skillset to fit the needs of clients and an open mind to any new techniques out there. <br />
	Actually, any webdeveloper who really loves his job goes being an 'open mind' and is always searching for the next new thing which might change the world!
</p>
<p>
	At the bottom of the pyramid of webdevelopers the above is all you'll ever need, but going up the ladder all the lines between developers and managers, and frontend and backend become a lot more vague! <br />
	As a webdeveloper you'll have to manage the wishes and expectations of your client and work with your team to get him what he wants eventhough a client rarely knows what he really wants or his wishes change during the course of the project.
</p>

<h4>My Skills</h4>
<p>
	Ok, so my skills? I'm a flexible, smart and enthusiastic programmer! <br />
	In the past I've learned to use various techniques, but more importantly I've learned to learn them! 
	As a programmer you at some point learn to quickly adapt to new techniques and can easily switch between programming languages. <br />
	<br />
	Below I'll tell you something about the ones I curently have enough experience in to use them for a real client withouth any prior research / training.
</p>
<h5>Server sided scripting languages</h5>
<p>
	Though every programming language could serve webpages some are more adapt at it and more importantly, more accepted! <br />
	When choosing a language for a webapplication it's important to choose one which fits the needs of the client and match the skillset of the team working on it. <br />
	<ul>
		<li>PHP</li>
		<li>NodeJS</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5>Frameworks</h5>
<p>
	Most webapplications share a lot of functionality and to avoid having to reinvent the wheel everytime we use libraries or bundles of libraries called frameworks to a strong foundation for our webapplication. <br />
	With so many open source communities building and maintaining frameworks having a homebrew framework nowadays is like a upstream battle. <br />
	In the past 2 years I've gone from maintaining a homebrew framework to exploring almost all major PHP frameworks out there! <br />
	<br />
	Though I've tried many the one I've come to love is <i>Symfony2</i> since this is (curently) the framework that's the most elegant and just using it forces you to become a better programmer. <br />
	There are many more out there such as Yii, Fuel, Flow, Lithium. etc. and I'm sure I could also learn to love those if I spend some time working with those! <br />
	<ul>
		<li>Symfony2 (PHP)</li>
		<li>ExpressJS (NodeJS)</li>
		<li>Djangode (NodeJS)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5>CMS</h5>
<p>
	The choice between starting a webapplication based on a framework or a CMS (or from scratch even) can be a tough one and is almost as important as the choice of the programming language (or maybe even more important!). <br />
	Using a CMS might give you a lot of out-of-the-box functionality but if you won't be using 80% of it then it will (unnecessarly) slow your webapplication down. <br />
	Most open source CMS out there also enforce a lot less 'pretty' programming and achitecture! <br />
	But their communities supply you with a lot of (free) modules which can save you weeks of development! <br />
	<ul>
		<li>Drupal</li>
		<li>Joomla</li>
		<li>Wordpress</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5>HTML / CSS - markup and style</h5>
<p>
	Webapplications are all about delivering content to people visiting your website using a webbrowser. <br />
	For this we're limited to using <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i> for the presentation of the content we deliver. <br /><br />
	A lot of developers split the tasks of developing a webapplication into 'frontend' and 'backend' and forfeit mastering the 'other side'. <br />
	Even in a team big enough to allow splitting tasks in such a manner I believe that you should be able to both equally! <br />
	<ul>
		<li>(X)HTML (HTML5)</li>
		<li>CSS (CSS3)</li>
		<li>LESS</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5>Rich Internet Applications</h5>
<p>
	The term 'Rich Internet Application' (short: RIA) means that websites nowadays are evolving to look a lot more like a real application (hence we call them webapplications). <br />
	To create a more pleasant user experience we use <i>javascript</i> to enhance our <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i>. <br />
	This can be as simple as a small dropdown menu or as complex as an application being completely <i>AJAX</i> powered. <br />
	<br />
	Eventhough <i>javascript</i> can be a elegant language, it can also (very quickly) become a big mess. <br />
	To keep your <i>javascript</i> clean and to save yourself a lot of time everyone nowadays uses a framework (be it open source or homebrew). <br />
	<ul>
		<li>Javascript</li>
		<li>AJAX</li>
		<li>jQuery / MooTools / Prototype</li>
		<li>ExtJS</li>
		<li>Flash (ActionScript)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5>Other languages</h5>
<p>
	Some other languages I'm familiar with but which do not fit in the above categories. <br />
	<ul>
		<li>Bash</li>
		<li>Ruby</li>
		<li>Lingo</li>
		<li>XML</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5>Automation</h5>
<p>
	I'd almost consider placing automation at the top of the list since lately this has become one of the major assets I can add to a team! <br />
	Even if we would ignore all the cloud hosting these days automation is already something you should invert your time in as webdeveloper. <br />
	<br />
	In a world where quality (often through testing) is very important and on the other hand the amount of changes and releases done daily is very high it's not uncommon for (human) error to occur. <br />
	The road to a full grown continuous integration cycle is a long and steep one, but every step you take will (noticeably!) increase the quality of your work and the satisfaction of your clients! <br />
	<ul>
		<li>Voiture (Drupal, homebrew, open source)</li>
		<li>Capistrano</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5>Version Control</h5>
<p>
	Withouth version control my job would be horible! I can't believe what life would be like with <i>SVN</i> and I'd love a life where every mastered <i>GIT</i>. <br />
	I'm a big fan of github for open source communities and <i>GIT</i> provides such an edge over <i>SVN</i>, being able to create branches for everything you want and rarely having problems merging. <br />
	<ul>
		<li>CVS</li>
		<li>SVN</li>
		<li>GIT (github)</li>
	</ul>

</p>

<h5>Server software</h5>
<p>
	There are so many tools available to be installed on your servers that I could never list them all so curently the the most important are by far the following; <br />
	<i>Linux</i> is at the base of most webservers beating Windows servers by far and I've grown to love <i>Linux</i> so much that I've even switched from working on Windows to Ubuntu on my (work)laptop. <br />
	<i>Apache2</i> is the piece of software which lives between the requests going to your webserver and your actual webapplication and you should know it by heart. <br />
	<i>Varnish</i> is a reverse proxy which allows you to cache webpages on high trafic websites. Developing a webapplication which will run behind a reverse proxy either requires a perfect setup of your webapplications (with correct headers and such) or if you're running a (for caching) horible system like Drupal you will have to trick both systems into working together! <br />
	Last is <i>Apache SOLR</i>, a very advanced (and FAST!) search engine which can be configured to fit all you'll ever need in a search engine. <br />
	<ul>
		<li>Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS)</li>
		<li>Apache2</li>
		<li>Varnish</li>
		<li>Apache SOLR</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5>Databases</h5>
<p>
	The backbone of most webapplications is a database and there are a lot of database servers out there. <br />
	The most traditional database servers are SQL databases and are all a lot alike. <br />
	A fairly new trend in webdevelopment is the usage of the so-called 'NoSQL' databases and depending on the problems it's always a good idea to consider using these. <br />
	Especially NodeJS has real nice chemistry with NoSQL database since these are also often non-blocking! <br />
	<ul>
		<li>MySQL (SQLLite, MSSQL, Access)</li>
		<li>MongoDB, CouchDB</li>
	</ul>
</p>
